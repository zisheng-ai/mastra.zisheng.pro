# Mastra site mirror

This branch deploys a complete Mastra landing page together with the latest
documentation source from the official
[mastra-ai/mastra](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra) repository.

The documentation source is imported from upstream `main/docs` without old
release branches or a multi-version documentation setup. See [UPSTREAM.md](./UPSTREAM.md)
for the exact synced commit.

The landing page is maintained locally because Mastra's marketing website
source is not public. The documentation remains an upstream snapshot and is
updated only from `main/docs`.

This is an independent deployment mirror and is not the official Mastra site.
The official website is available at [mastra.ai](https://mastra.ai).

The site publishes Simplified Chinese at the root URL, plus English, Japanese,
Taiwan Traditional Chinese, and Hong Kong Traditional Chinese under localized
paths. The language switcher preserves the current page and the visitor's most
recent language choice.

## Development

Requires Node.js 22 or later and pnpm 11 or later.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` builds and serves every locale so language switching works across
the complete site. For faster hot-reload development of only the Simplified
Chinese locale, run `pnpm dev:fast`. The other single-locale commands are
`pnpm dev:en`, `pnpm dev:ja`, `pnpm dev:zh-TW`, and `pnpm dev:zh-HK`.

Build the production site with:

```bash
pnpm build
```

The static output is written to `build/`.

## Sync the latest upstream docs

Keep the official clone at `../github/mastra`, commit a clean local working
tree, and run:

```bash
pnpm sync:upstream
```

Set `MASTRA_UPSTREAM_DIR` if the official clone is stored elsewhere. The sync
command follows only upstream `main`. It stops for manual review if upstream
changed files that contain this mirror's domain or analytics adaptations.

## Deployment environment

Set these values only on the production deployment:

```bash
DEPLOY_ENV=production
SITE_URL=https://mastra.zisheng.pro
GA_ID=G-XSL4QXVXDB
```
