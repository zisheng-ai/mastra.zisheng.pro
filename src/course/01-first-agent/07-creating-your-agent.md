# Creating Your Agent

Let's create a simple agent that will help users analyze financial transaction data. We'll create a new file called `agents/financial-agent.ts`.

First, create the new agent file at src/mastra/agents/financial-agent.ts

Now add the necessary imports at the top of your file:

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'
// We'll import our tool in a later step
```

Now, let's create our agent:

```typescript
export const financialAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Financial Assistant Agent',
  instructions: `ROLE DEFINITION

  model: 'openai/gpt-5.4',
  tools: {}, // We'll add tools in a later step
})
```

This creates a financial assistant agent with a well-defined system prompt that outlines its role, capabilities, behavioral guidelines, constraints, and success criteria.
