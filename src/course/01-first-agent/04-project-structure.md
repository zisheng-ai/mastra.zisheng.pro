# Verifying Project Structure

Let's check that your project has the correct structure. You should have:

1. A `src/mastra` directory that contains:
   - `index.ts` - The main entry point for your Mastra project
   - `agents/` - Directory containing individual agent files
   - `scorers/` - Directory containing individual scorer files
   - `tools/` - Directory containing individual tool files
   - `workflows/` - Directory containing individual workflow files

If the CLI created your project, you should see files like:

- `agents/weather-agent.ts` - Example weather agent
- `scorers/weather-scorer.ts` - Example weather scorer
- `tools/weather-tool.ts` - Example weather tool
- `workflows/weather-workflow.ts` - Example weather workflow

This structure is important because it follows the Mastra convention for organizing your code. The `index.ts` file is the main entry point for your Mastra project, while the `agents` and `tools` directories contain the definitions for your agents and tools, respectively.
