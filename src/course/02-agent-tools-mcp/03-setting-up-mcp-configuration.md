# Setting Up MCP Configuration

Now, let's create a basic MCP configuration in your agent file. Open your `src/mastra/agents/index.ts` file and add the following imports:

```typescript
import { MCPClient } from '@mastra/mcp'
```

Then, create a basic MCP configuration object:

```typescript
const mcp = new MCPClient({
  servers: {
    // We'll add servers in the next steps
  },
})
```

This configuration object will be used to specify which MCP servers your agent should connect to. The `servers` property is an object where each key is a unique identifier for a server, and the value contains the configuration for that server.

In the upcoming steps, we'll add various MCP servers to this configuration, giving your agent access to a wide range of tools and services.
