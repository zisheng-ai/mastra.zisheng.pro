  title: 'Build Your First AI Agent in TypeScript',
  description: `This course is your roadmap to becoming an AI Engineer.

In 90 minutes, you'll build and deploy your first agent in TypeScript with Mastra. Along the way, you'll learn how the agent loop works under the hood, how tools let an agent reach into other systems, how MCP opens the door to external resources, and how context engineering and memory shape behavior across a conversation.                

By the end, you'll have shipped your first agent - and more importantly, you'll know how to build the next one on your own. The patterns you implement here carry directly into whatever you choose to build next.                                                                              

AI agents are the next platform shift. Understanding how to build them is now a core skill for engineers, and there's real opportunity for those who get there early. If you're excited about what's possible and want a clear, practical path to get there, this course is for you.`,
